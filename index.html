    During this project, I worked on the door transition, camera movement, and some of the audio. I also worked on the
    Zoomer and Zeb enemy mechanics. This was accomplished through an extensive use of coroutines and raycasts.
</p>

<p>
    I also collaborated on the custom game level/mechanic and made sure the game was authentic.

<p>
    The game engine and language used for this project were Unity and C# respectively.
