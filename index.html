    During this project, I worked on the door transition, camera movement, and some of the audio. I also worked on the
    Zoomer and Zeb enemy mechanics. This was accomplished through an extensive use of coroutines and raycasts.
</p>

<p>
    I also collaborated on the custom game level/mechanic and made sure the game was authentic.
</p>

<p>
    The game engine and language used for this project were Unity and C# respectively.

<h2>Bird Defense</h2>

    This project is a tower defense game with a bird theme. My most interesting enemy mechanic is that there is an enemy
    that is invisible to all birds and can only be visible to the birds if there is a beacon near the bird.

<p>
    I also had to make a lot of decisions to balance out the waves and make the user experience for the shop easy to understand
    and use.
